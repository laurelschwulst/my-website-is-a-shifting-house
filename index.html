        <h2 id="what">What is a website?</h2>

        <p>
          For the past handful of years, I’ve been teaching courses about
          interactive design and the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the
          internet’s impact on art—and vice versa—and how technological advance
          often coincides with artistic development.
        </p>

        <p>
          In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup
          and code languages of the web—HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing
          emails from students asking, “<span class="highlight"
            >So how do I actually make a website?</span
          >”
        </p>

        <p>
          This sparked my own questioning. “<span class="highlight"
            >What is a website, anyway?</span
          >” It’s easy to forget. Today there are millions of ways to make a
          website, and the abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is
          still the same as ever before:
        </p>

        <p>
          A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A
          server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet, so that
          when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website.
          Usually you have to pay for a server. You also have to pay for a
          domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points
          to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your
          server.
        </p>

        <p>
          Links (rendered default blue and underlined—they’re the hypertext “HT”
          in HTML) are the oxygen of the web. Not all websites have links, but
          all links connect to other webpages, within the same site or
          elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually
          making a website, they are referring to a website
          <em>in the world … today</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s healthy to acknowledge today’s web is much different than the web
          many of us grew up using. So when they ask how to make a website
          (despite having already “learned”), they are alluding to the
          technological friction and social pressures that often come along with
          creating and maintaining a website in 2018.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their
          users, universally popular social media sites—like Facebook,
          Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that
          prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’
          happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you
          to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In
          this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is
          looking out for you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when
          individuals tell me they want their website to do the job of “setting
          the record straight” on who they are and what they do.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website.
          There are other legitimate states of mind capable of communication—a
          surprising, memorable, monumental, soothing, shocking, unpredictable,
          radically boring, bizarre, mind-blowing, very quiet and subtle, and/or
          amazing website could work. You also need not limit yourself to only
          one website—as perhaps you’d like to confuse or surprise with
          multiple.
        </p>

        <p>
          My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject
          and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both
          author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities
          as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a
          website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle?
          Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop:
          when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form
          your own identity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">Why have a website?</h2>

        <p>
          Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to
          guide the web’s future. The web is called the web because its vitality
          depends on just that—an interconnected web of individual nodes
          breathing life into a vast network. This web needs to actually work
          for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big
          corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply
          by having a website. I think artists, in particular, could be
          instrumental in this space—showing the world where the web can go.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves
          and then, when they share their work, for others. Of course,
          world-building means creating everything—not only making things inside
          the world but also the surrounding world itself—the language, style,
          rules, and architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create
          not only works (the “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the
          arrangement of rooms, the architecture!). Ideally, the two would
          inform each other in a virtuous, self-perfecting loop. This can be
          incredibly nurturing to an artist’s practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why
          not have a personal website that works strategically, in parallel to
          your other activities? How could a website complement what you already
          do rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or
          thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How can
          the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your
          approach?
        </p>

        <p>
          A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an
          archive of your complete works. That’s going to be dead the moment you
          publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished.
          It’s imperfect—maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that’s the
          beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to
          websites after death, anyway?

        <h2 id="be">What can a website be?</h2>

        <h3>Website as room</h3>

        <p>
          In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it’s
          finite, often with a specific intended purpose.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/web1.jpg"
            alt="A sparrow sitting outside a window, looking in and saying (as indicated by a speech bubble) 'In an age of information overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context.'"
          />
          <figcaption>Louis Rossetto</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or
          even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion. You can
          also position elements in spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances
          to adjacent rooms through links.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early days of The Creative Independent, we sometimes thought of
          TCI’s website like a house next to a river. We considered the
          interviews the flowing water, as they were our house’s nutrients and
          source of life. We would collect and drink from the water every day.
          But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would
          change our house. We’d wake up to see a new door where a picture frame
          once was. Knowledge became the architect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like any metaphor, it’s not perfect. For better or worse, it’s much
          more difficult to delete a building than a website.
        </p>

          <img
            src="images/web2.jpg"
            alt="A sparrow standing on the ledge of a bowl, with some rice in its mouth, saying (as indicated by a speech bubble), 'Arguably, the personal website is more important than social media platforms (though not, of course, than email, which is the face of work today), since at least its structure – not its distribution – is independent of the platforms of huge corporations like Facebook/Instagram, Tumblr/Yahoo!, or Google.'"

        <h3>Website as shelf</h3>

        <p>
          Zooming into this room inside this house, we see a shelf. Maybe a
          shelf is easier to think about than a whole room. What does one put on
          a shelf? Books and objects from life? Sure, go ahead. Thankfully
          there’s nothing too heavy on the shelf, or else it would break. A few
          small things will do, knowledge-containing or not. Plus, lighter
          things are easy to change out. Is a book or trinket “so last year?”
          Move it off the shelf! Consider what surprising juxtapositions you can
          make on your little shelf.
        </p>

        <h3>Website as plant</h3>

        <p>
          Plants can’t be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be
          the same way, as long as you pick the right soil, water it (but not
          too much), and provide adequate sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day
          and let it gradually grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year
          it’ll bear fruit, if you’re lucky. Fruit could be friends or
          admiration or money—success comes in many forms. But don’t get too
          excited or set goals: that’s not the idea here. Like I said, plants
          can’t be rushed.
        </p>

        <h3>Website as garden</h3>

        <p>
          Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind.
          Sometimes, once they’re little seedlings and can stand on their own,
          it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might
          happen, and that’s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active
          months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around
          on input. You need both. Plants remind us that life is about balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to
          quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/web4.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Fred Rogers</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Website as puddle</h3>

        <p>
          A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection
          of rainwater. They usually appear after rainstorms. Like a storm,
          creating a website can happen in a burst. Sometimes it’s nice to have
          a few bursts/storms of creating a website, since the zone can be so
          elusive. Some people even call rain “<span class="highlight"
            >computer weather</span
          >.”
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also no state of “completeness” to a website, like a puddle,
          since they’re ephemeral by nature. Sometimes they can be very big and
          reflective. Despite their temporal nature, I’ve even seen some
          creatures thrive in puddles. Meanwhile, some smaller puddles may only
          last a day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible
          reflective surface, needs to last long. If the world doesn’t end
          tomorrow, there will be another storm. And where there’s a hole, a
          puddle will appear again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would
          love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.
        </p>

        <h3>Website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean</h3>

        <p>
          Sometimes you don’t want a website that you’ll have to maintain. You
          have other things to do. Why not consider your website a beautiful
          rock with a unique shape which you spent hours finding, only to throw
          it into the water until it hits the ocean floor? You will never know
          when it hits the floor, and you won’t care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over
          again, if you like. You can throw as many websites as you want into
          the ocean. When an idea comes, find a rock and throw it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="web">The web is what we make it</h2>

        <p>
          While an individual website could be any of those metaphors I
          mentioned above, I believe the common prevailing metaphor—the internet
          as cloud—is problematic. The internet is not one all-encompassing,
          mysterious, and untouchable thing. (In early patent drawings depicting
          the internet, it appears as related shapes: a blob, brain, or
          explosion.) These metaphors obfuscate the reality that the internet is
          made up of individual nodes: individual computers talking to other
          individual computers.
        </p>

        <figure><img src="images/web6.png" /></figure>

        <p>
          The World Wide Web recently turned 29. On the web’s birthday, Tim
          Berners Lee, its creator, published a letter stating the web’s current
          state of threat. He says that while it’s called the “World Wide Web,”
          only about half the world is connected, so we should close this
          digital divide.
        </p>

        <p>
          But at the same time, Berners Lee wants to make sure this thing we’re
          all connecting to is truly working for us, as individuals: “<span
            class="highlight"
            >I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web. I
            want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather
            than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions</span
          >.”
        </p>

        <figure><img src="images/web7.png" /></figure>

        <p>
          “<span class="highlight">Metaphor unites reason and imagination</span
          >,” says George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book, Metaphors We
          Live By (1980). “Metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In
          fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors. It is as
          though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a
          sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing
          the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world. Metaphor
          is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as
          precious.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of a cloud, let’s use a metaphor that makes the web’s
          individual, cooperative nodes more visible. This way, we can remember
          the responsibility we each have in building a better web. The web is a
          flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks, each tending or
          forgetting about their web garden or puddle home with a river of
          knowledge nearby.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and
          dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that
          websites progress along with us. It’s especially pressing when forces
          continue to threaten the web and the internet at large. In an age of
          information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists
          of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively
          about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space
          on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.
